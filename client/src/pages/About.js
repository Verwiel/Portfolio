          <h2>How I got where I am</h2>
          <p className='body-1'>I was born and raised in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. After attaining a Bachelors degree in Business from the University of Wisconsin Stout my girlfriend and I packed up her Nissan Sentra and moved out to Salt Lake City, Utah. While working at Park City / Canyons Mountain Resorts I decided I wanted to get into a more fulfilling career (not that snowboarding every day wasnâ€™t awesome). I explored my options for a degree in Computer Science, unable to afford going back to college, I decided to attend Helio Trainings Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp in hopes of getting my foot in the door somewhere and continuing to grow my knowledge.</p>

          <h2>Where I'm looking to go next</h2>
          <p className='body-1'>I love what I do and the endless possibilities of what to learn next and what direction to take my career. No matter where I end up, I know that this is the industry I want to be in. I am still planning on going back to school for Computer Science. I am more than happy to stay in web development for the time being but long term I want to expand my knowledge more into the world of Software Engineering.</p>
          <p className='body-1'>In the immediate future I am looking to start my journey towards software engineering as well as open myself up to freelance opportunities.</p>
